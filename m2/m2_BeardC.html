        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am recent graduating HS senior but I had started college work in WSU Tech during my senior year through the Jumpstart program. The reason that I am taking this class is to learn more about Websites on both the front end and the back end (which this course may not talk about but will still help in the CSS and Javascript parts of my knowledge) When I am not in class I am working in customer service, playing gaming with my friends, or creating little projects with different coding languages.</p>
